[Ruby](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) is required for installation.

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is recommended.

[Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is what I use in my dotfiles. To make everything look good you will have to set your terminal to use the color scheme.

**To install:**

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b-boogaard/overlord/master/terminal-setup.sh | sh
```
